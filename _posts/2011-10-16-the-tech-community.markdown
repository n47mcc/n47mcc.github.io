I remember walking through New York City with my wonderful Aunt one day
in the middle of my High School career. She asked me why I continued to play trumpet. It was an insightful question because I started playing trumpet in 5th grade, so my reasons were probably pretty shallow at the time (and they were). I had never thought about why I continued to do it. There were a host of reasons really:
*  To look good on college applications
*  To enrich my mind musically
*  Sheer momentum of years of playing


But the answer I gave surprised me. I said it was the community of
trumpet players that really contributed to my interest in the art. If
you put me in a room with a bunch of trumpet players the conversation
would quickly become trumpet focused. It's just so great to sit with
people and talk about mouthpieces, trumpet players, songs, techniques
and experiences. When you do that you realize that playing trumpet
becomes kind of a shared experience, with each of you contributing a
litle bit to an ever-evolving craft. It's a wonderfully jazzy notion
for sure.


## Web 2.0 Conference


On October 10-13 myself and several other members of the Marist Tech
community went to the [Web 2.0
Conference](http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2011/) in New York, NY. It was an
awesome experience. I have always tried to go to local tech conferences,
I have been to one barcamp, one bsides and another homegrown security
conference in Connecticut called eXcon. These are great experiences too,
but you often find yourself interacting with a lot of the same people
you already know, with the addition of a few special guests.
 
  
The Web 2.0 Conference was a totally difference experience. Hundreds of
people, and I only knew three other people. As a result I got exposed to
a lot of people and viewpoints I might not have otherwise been exposed
to. Designers, businessmen, big companies, small companies and
practically non-existant companies were all in attendance.
 
  
However, even with 200 people it was very much like when I hang out with
a room of trumpet players. The shared experience we all had was working
with technology. Everyone fed off of the energy of the other attendees
and at the end of each day I felt completely inspired to write the next
awesome website, to invent the next transformation technology, or just
contribute to the evolution of this increasingly connected world we call
the web. And I would have embarked on these endeavors too had I not been
completely wiped from the 7 AM - 7 PM days.
 
  
Thanks to everyone who put the Web 2.0 Conference together (especially
for the 65% student discount), see you next time!
